# Guess Game (Random)

This is a simple Python guessing game.

## How it works
- The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
- The user tries to guess the number.
- If the guess is too high, the program prints: "wala as7bi b3dti"
- If the guess is too low, the program prints: "ziyd chwiya a bro"
- If the guess is correct, the program prints: "mbrok 3lik Bro🎉" and the game stops.


## how to run
```bash
python3 game.py
